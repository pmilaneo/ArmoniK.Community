# ArmoniK

Hi! We are excited that you are interested in ArmoniK and want to make it even better! This document is a general guide we would like our contributors to follow. Before submitting your contribution, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guide.

## The project

<!-- Add a short but comprehensive description of Armonik -->

ArmoniK is a large project and because of it's complexity, we decided to splitted it into **many autonomous repositories** (as mars 2023, ArmoniK was composed by 14 repositories).

## Way of working

In spite of this autonomy that repositories have, we think it's **essential** for each of them to have the **same way of working**. We have written each process we use to build ArmoniK together.

- [Discuss First](./2.working-processes/1.discuss-first.md)
- [Submission guidelines](./2.working-processes/2.submission-guidelines.md)
- [Release processes](./2.working-processes/3.release-processes.md)

Feel free to ask if there is something you don't understand. The whole ArmoniK team would be delighted to answer you.

## Tech stack

In addition to processes and **for each language** you could find in ArmoniK, we created a **contribution guide**.

- [TypeScript](./2.contribution-guides/1.typescript.md)

Feel free to ask if there is something you don't understand. The whole ArmoniK team would be delighted to answer you.
