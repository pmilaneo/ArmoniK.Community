# Discuss First

Create a new issue and talk to us about it before attempting to create a feature pull request.
It will help maintainers in comprehending your requirements and ensuring that you take steps that are appropriate for ArmoniK's future.

If you have an idea or want to discuss an issue with the community, you can alternatively create a discussion in our [Discussions Channel](https://github.com/aneoconsulting/ArmoniK/discussions).
